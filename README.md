# Singapore-Resale-Flat-Prices-Predicting

Welcome to the Singapore Resale Flat Prices Prediction project! This project involves the development of a machine learning model to predict resale prices of flats in Singapore. By leveraging historical transaction data, the goal is to assist potential buyers and sellers in estimating the resale value of a flat.The Singapore resale flat market is known for its competitiveness, making it challenging for individuals to accurately gauge the resale value of their property. This project aims to address this challenge by employing machine learning techniques to provide users with reliable resale price predictions based on various influential factors.

# Problem Statement
The challenge lies in accurately predicting resale values, considering factors such as location, flat type, floor area, and lease duration. The project seeks to provide a practical solution that benefits both buyers and sellers in making well-informed decisions.

# Approach
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Collect and clean historical resale flat transaction data from the Singapore Housing and Development Board (HDB).

2. Feature Engineering:

Extract relevant features such as town, flat type, storey range, floor area, flat model, and lease commence date. Create additional features to improve prediction accuracy.

3. Model Selection and Training:

Choose a suitable regression model and train it on the historical dataset.

4. Model Evaluation:

Assess the model's predictive performance using regression metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R2 Score.

5. Streamlit Web Application:

Develop an intuitive web application using Streamlit, allowing users to input flat details for price predictions.

6. Deployment on Render:

Deploy the Streamlit application on the Render platform or any cloud platform for online accessibility.

7. Testing and Validation:

Thoroughly test the deployed application to ensure accurate predictions and seamless functionality.

# Results

The project aims to empower potential buyers and sellers in the Singapore housing market, providing them with a valuable tool for estimating resale prices and making informed decisions. It also showcases the practical application of machine learning in the real estate sector and web development.
